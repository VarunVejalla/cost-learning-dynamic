To implement the proposed changes outlined in the project proposal "Guided Cost Learning in Multi-Agent Dynamic Games," you’ll need to focus on redesigning the agent cost framework using a neural network (NN) representation, as this is the key innovation over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach by Mehr et al. (2023). The proposal suggests replacing the manually chosen feature-based cost functions with a small encoder neural network to learn cost vectors, which will then inform the forward and inverse solutions for multi-agent dynamic games. Given the timeline (starting April 4, 2025, per the document, and today being April 5, 2025), you’re right on track to begin.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on where to start and how to proceed, aligning with the proposal’s goals and your prior work with `simple.jl`.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Baseline (SOTA) and Your Starting Point
- **SOTA Reference**: Review "Maximum-Entropy Multi-Agent Dynamic Games: Forward and Inverse Solutions" (Mehr, Wang, Schwager, 2023). The proposal states you’ve experimented with their code, so ensure you’re familiar with:
  - How they compute Entropic Cost Equilibrium (ECE) policies for the "forward" problem.
  - Their iterative algorithm for the "inverse" problem (learning cost functions from demonstrations).
  - Their use of manually chosen quadratic features (e.g., efficiency, safety) for cost representation.
- **Your Current Code (`simple.jl`)**: You’ve implemented a multi-agent IRL framework with:
  - Linear-quadratic (LQ) dynamics.
  - Feature matching IRL using gradient descent to recover `theta`.
  - A decoupled two-agent system with known dynamics.
  - This will serve as a foundation, but you’ll need to extend it to handle unknown dynamics, nonlinear costs, and NN-based cost representation.

**Starting Action**: Clone or set up the Mehr et al. codebase alongside `simple.jl`. Identify where their cost functions are defined (likely as quadratic functions of state and action features) and where your `theta` parameters fit in `simple.jl` (`set_up_system` function).

### Step 2: Define the Neural Network Cost Representation
The proposal suggests an **autoencoder-like structure** to learn cost vectors (`w_i`) for each agent, which will replace the `theta`-based cost matrices in `simple.jl`. Here’s how to start:

#### Key Components from the Proposal
- **Inputs and Outputs**:
  - `S_t`: State of all agents at time `t` (n-dimensional).
  - `u_{i,t}`: Action of agent `i` at time `t` (d-dimensional).
  - `w_i`: Private cost vector for agent `i` (m-dimensional embedding).
- **Three Networks**:
  1. **Cost Encoder**: Maps `S_t` and all `u_{i,t}` to `w_i` (learns cost vectors).
  2. **Policy Network**: Maps `S_t` and `w_i` to `u_{i,t}` (learns actions from costs).
  3. **Dynamics Network**: Maps `w_i` and `u_{i,t}` to `S_{t+1}` (learns dynamics if unknown; skip if dynamics are known).

#### Implementation Starting Point
- **Choose a Framework**: Use a deep learning library like PyTorch or TensorFlow (Python-based), as Julia’s NN ecosystem (e.g., Flux.jl) is less mature for rapid prototyping. You can interface this with `simple.jl` later via Python-Julia interoperability (e.g., PyCall.jl).
- **Design the Encoder NN**:
  - Start with a simple feedforward NN for the cost encoder:
    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn

    class CostEncoder(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim, num_agents, embedding_dim):
            super(CostEncoder, self).__init__()
            input_dim = state_dim + num_agents * action_dim  # S_t + all u_{i,t}
            self.layers = nn.Sequential(
                nn.Linear(input_dim, 128),
                nn.ReLU(),
                nn.Linear(128, embedding_dim)  # Outputs w_i
            )
        
        def forward(self, state, actions):
            x = torch.cat([state, actions], dim=-1)  # Concatenate S_t and all u_{i,t}
            return self.layers(x)
    ```
  - For `simple.jl`, `state_dim = 8`, `action_dim = 2`, `num_agents = 2`, and pick `embedding_dim = 6` (to match the 6D `theta`).

- **Integrate with `simple.jl`**:
  - Replace `set_up_system(theta)` with a function that uses the NN to generate cost matrices:
    ```julia
    function set_up_system_nn(state, actions, encoder)
        # Call Python NN via PyCall
        w = py"encoder(torch.tensor($state), torch.tensor($actions)).detach().numpy()"
        w_state1 = w[1] * Matrix{Float64}(I, state_dim, state_dim)
        w_ctrl11 = w[2] * Matrix{Float64}(I, ctrl_dim_1, ctrl_dim_1)
        # ... (similar for other weights)
        # Return Dynamics, Costs as before
    end
    ```

**Starting Action**: Install PyTorch (`pip install torch`), write the `CostEncoder` class, and test it with dummy data matching `simple.jl`’s dimensions (e.g., `state = [10, 10, 0, 0, -10, 10, 0, 0]`, `actions = [0, 0, 0, 0]`).

---

### Step 3: Modify the Forward Algorithm
- **Goal**: Compute approximate ECE policies using the NN-based costs.
- **In `simple.jl`**: The `generate_sim` function computes policies via `lqgame_QRE`. Adapt this to use the NN:
  - Replace `Dynamics, Costs = set_up_system(theta)` with `Dynamics, Costs = set_up_system_nn(state, actions, encoder)`.
  - Ensure `lqgame_QRE` can handle the resulting cost matrices (it likely can, as they’re still matrices).
- **Unknown Dynamics**: If extending to unknown dynamics, implement the dynamics network (e.g., another NN predicting `S_{t+1}` from `w_i` and `u_{i,t}`). For now, stick with known dynamics (`A`, `B1`, `B2`) to simplify.

**Starting Action**: Modify `generate_sim` to call the NN-based cost function and verify it produces trajectories similar to the original.

---

### Step 4: Redesign the Inverse Algorithm
- **Goal**: Learn the NN weights (encoder parameters) instead of `theta` via IRL.
- **In `simple.jl`**: The IRL loop in `ma_irl()` updates `theta_curr` with gradient descent. Replace this with NN training:
  - **Loss Function** (from proposal):
    - `|S - predicted S|` (dynamics prediction error, optional if dynamics known).
    - Match with known dynamics (skip for now).
    - ECE quality (approximated linearly, per the proposal).
  - **New IRL Loop**:
    ```python
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(encoder.parameters(), lr=0.001)
    for itr in range(500):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        # Generate trajectories with current encoder
        # (Call modified generate_sim via PyCall)
        # Compute feature counts or trajectory loss
        loss = torch.mean((demo_features - sim_features) ** 2)  # Simplified feature matching
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    ```

**Starting Action**: Sketch a Python script that trains the `CostEncoder` using demonstration trajectories from `simple.jl` (e.g., those generated with `theta_true`).

---

### Step 5: Address Open Questions
- **NN Type**: Start with a simple feedforward NN (not RNN or VAE) for proof-of-concept simplicity.
- **Single vs. Whole Trajectory**: Begin with single-timestep inputs (`S_t`, `u_{i,t}`) to match `simple.jl`’s structure, then explore whole trajectories later.
- **Loss Weighting**: Use equal weights (e.g., 1.0) for now; tune later based on results.

**Starting Action**: Note these decisions in your code comments for later refinement.
